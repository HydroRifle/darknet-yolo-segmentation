# darknet-yolo-segmentation
This project is based on darknet to get image segmentation


1、"make -j6"         -----compile the source code



2、"./darknet segmenter train the/path/to/cfg/data the/paht/to/cfg/file the/path/to/weights/files"   ------train on your own data



3、"./darknet segmenter test the/path/to/cfg/data the/path/to/cfg/file the/path/to/weights/files the/path/to/image "  ------test your trained network



4、 "python get_mask.py"         -----this python script is to get mask

I will update our code on time, if you want to get cfg/file and weights file, please contact me by email at:2239779352@qq.com
