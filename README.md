1、compile the source code by "make -j6"



2、with the command "./darknet segmenter train the/path/to/cfg/data the/paht/to/cfg/file the/path/to/weights/files" to train on your data



3、with the command "./darknet segmenter test the/path/to/cfg/data the/path/to/cfg/file the/path/to/weights/files the/path/to/cfg/file the/path/to/image " to test your results



4、 run "python get_mask.py" to get mask

I will update our code on time, if you want to get cfg/file and weights file, please contact me by email at:2239779352@qq.com
